# Stuff I have not done yet

* Rewrite the docker swarm stuff using salt.modules.swarm
  which I didn't know existed
* Add some services as second stage (say gitea?)
* Add portainer or some other manager UI
* Use beacons/reactors to restart salt-minion when salt config is changed
* Add NFS volumes for docker
