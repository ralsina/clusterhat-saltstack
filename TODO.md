# Stuff I have not done yet

* Add netshare (see https://github.com/ContainX/docker-volume-netshare/issues/187)
* Rewrite the docker swarm stuff using salt.modules.swarm
  which I didn't know existed
* Add some services as second stage (say gitea?)
* Add portainer or some other manager UI
* Use beacons/reactors to restart salt-minion when salt config is changed
* Add NFS volumes for docker
* Implement some sort of cluster dashboard (should be fun)
* Add docs about adding other nodes to the docker cluster (my Mele 1000!)
* Something to do about file deduplication for the NFS server
