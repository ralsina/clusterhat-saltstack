# Salt State Files

The files in this tree are used to configure Arcade, my home
cluster/swarm/bramble.

In this folder are basic setup files shared by all nodes.

* `controller/` has the configuration for pacman, the controller/manager
* `worker/` has the configuration details for swarm workers
* `arcade/` has configurations for software running on the swarm itself
* `ssh/` is access configuration for SSH on nodes
